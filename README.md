CS5340 - Image Denoising and Segmentation

Image Denoising is done using Gibbs Sampling within the Ising Model

Image Segmentation is done using Gaussian Mixture Model, intializing the means using K-Means algorithm
and then tuning the means and the variance using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm
